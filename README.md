## Grate
An entry into RookieHacks 2020. 

## Purspose
When buying something in bulk, each individual item is much cheaper than if you were to buy that same item sold individually. However, if you only need one of that item, buying it in bulk isn't feasible. However, were you to buy an item, let's say some pens, in bulk and split the cost with a few friends, who all also only need one pen. That would make it cheaper for everyone. Introducing, Grate, a platform that lets you buy things in bulk and split the cost with other people on the site.

## Future Developement
As of now, this app doesn't actually do anything, as we don't have the resources to set up a distribution network. Were we to continue this in the future, we would add credit card functionality so that users could actually use the platform to buy things. That would, of course, require more funds. We would also add reviews and comments to the products.
